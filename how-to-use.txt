This project comprises two main components:

A React.js application, representing the frontend single-page application (SPA).
A simulated backend API intended for communication with the React application to send and retrieve data.
To initiate both components, execute "npm install" in the respective project folders.

To start the backend API server, use "npm start" within the "backend-api" folder. Simultaneously, launch the React app's development server using "npm start" within the "react-frontend" folder.

Both backend and frontend servers must be operational to ensure the proper functionality of the projects.

The dummy backend API doesn't rely on an external database. Instead, it stores dummy data in an "events.json" file within its project folder.
